# Simple Chess

This repository contains a sample Android app for playing chess over Wi-Fi Direct. The actual application code lives in the `P2PChessApp` directory.

## Features
- **Peer-to-peer chess gameplay** over Wi-Fi Direct
- **Complete chess rule implementation** including special moves
- **Comprehensive unit test coverage** (72 tests with 100% pass rate)
- **Robust chess engine** with move validation and game state management

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Java 11 or higher
- Git

### Setup and Testing
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd simple-chess
   ```

2. **Run the automated setup script:**
   ```bash
   bash setup.sh
   ```
   This installs the Android SDK and configures the development environment.

3. **Execute the comprehensive test suite:**
   ```bash
   cd P2PChessApp
   ./gradlew testDebugUnitTest
   ```

### Test Coverage
The project includes **72 comprehensive unit tests** covering:
- âœ… Chess piece movement validation (all piece types)
- âœ… Game rule enforcement (castling, en passant, promotion)
- âœ… Check and checkmate detection
- âœ… Board state management and validation
- âœ… Move notation parsing and formatting
- âœ… Edge cases and error handling

**Current Status:** 72/72 tests passing (100% success rate)
